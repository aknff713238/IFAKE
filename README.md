# IFAKE - Image/Video Forgery Detection Application

IFAKE is an application that uses AI models to detect and classify image and video forgeries. This repository consists of two folders:
1. The web application project
2. The AI ipynb files through which the forgery detection models are derived.

## Research Paper and Dataset

We have conducted research on image forgery detection and classification and have published a research paper on it. You can find the link to the paper [here](https://example.com/paper). Additionally, we have created our own dataset, FIDAC, which we used in our research. The FIDAC dataset is a mixture of our own dataset and the CASIA dataset. You can find the link to our dataset [here](https://example.com/dataset).

## Pretrained Models

We have also trained and provided pretrained models for image and video forgery detection. You can find the links to download these models below:

1. Image forgery detection model: [link](https://example.com/image_model)
2. Video forgery detection model: [link](https://example.com/video_model)

## Web Application

Our web application is built on the Django framework. To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/IFAKE.git`
2. Navigate to the `web_application` directory: `cd IFAKE/web_application`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`

The web application can now be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/` on your web browser.
